to do here:
  add validated column to event_performers table
      -allows admin to approve specific performances

  routes for admin approving things
      -performers and performances

  add crud routes for stuff
      -should be very restricted in terms of which accounts are authorized
        -admin only or whatever
            -try to find a way to secure that, dont worry about it too much though
            
  route for saying a performer will be at an event
      -lets performers say they'll be at an event from the app

  route for notifications and stuff
      -do a check for unread notifications for dash board and stuff, more gen stuff
